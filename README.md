# Pandas-Paskhaver-2021

Learning Pandas by examples from book *"Pandas in Action"* by Boris Paskhaver published by Manning Publications in 2021.

The examples cover the following topics:
- filtering
- working with text data
- multiindexing
- reshaping
- grouping
- merging
- working with dates and times
- importing data from and exporting data in CSV, JSON, and Excel files
- configuring Pandas
- visualization by Matplotlib

My environment was Python 3.8 with NumPy 1.22.4 and Pandas 1.4.2. Additionally, xlrd 2.0.1 and openpyxl 3.0.10 were used for working with Excel workbooks, Matplotlib 3.6.1 for visualization, and Faker 15.1.1 for generating data.
