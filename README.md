# Pandas-Paskhaver-2021

Learning Pandas by examples from book "Pandas in Action" by Boris Paskhaver published by Manning in 2021.

The examples cover the following topics:
filtering, working with text data, multiindexing, reshaping, grouping, merging, working with dates and times, importing data from and exporting data in CSV, JSON, and Excel files, configuring, and visualization by Matplotlib.

With Python 3.8+, NumPy 1.22.4 and Pandas 1.4.2 are used. Additionally, xlrd 2.0.1 and openpyxl 3.0.10 are used for working with Excel workbooks, Matplotlib 3.6.1 for visualization, and Faker 15.1.1 for generating data.
